        <h3> Everybody needs a best friend in his life because we need someone on whom we can trust.</h3>
        <h3> Luckily, I have got a person like shweta and she is my only best friend and I trust her more than anyone else.</h3>
        <h3> No matter how complex the situation is, my best friend is always there to bail me out.</h3>
        <h3> My best friend hates to see me sad and she starts cracking a joke as soon as she senses the mood.</h3>
        <h3> I and my best friend often spend good time together- cracking jokes, games etc.</h3>
        <h3> We help each other in studies and together we attend the lectures, raise questions in class.</h3>
        <h3> She is a good student and her performance in the class is also good, all the subject teachers like her very much.</h3>
        <h3> My best friend always informs me about an important college announcement, in case I missed any.</h3>
        <h3> My best friend always persuades me to put an extra effort, to improve myself in studies and sports.</h3>
        <h3> Time flies like anything when I am with my best friend and play, study or simply chat.</h3>
        <h3> She also considers me as her best friend and in college we are known as a pair who is born to win.</h3>
        <h3> I do not consider her as my best friend, in fact I consider her as my family-member.</h3>
        <h3> We both are like each others best friend, teacher, guardian, supporter and care taker.</h3>
        <h3> She is not my girlfriend but more important than girlfriend. </h3>
        <h3> She is very important for me and I do not want to lose her.</h3>
        <h3> She is the only person whom I trust more and I love my Bestfriend❤️❤️</h3>
